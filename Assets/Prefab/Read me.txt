The NPC has many script components inside. These are:
Character Stats
NPC
Attacked Take Damage
Attacked Scrolling Text
On Death Ragdoll
Animation Update
Animation Controller(On the character model)

All of the NPC Ai is executed on the NPC component. Rest can be replaced with your own scripts if you need. 
But errors will occur if you just remove them because NPC componment uses those scripts. 

If you wish to change the character model just copy paste all the components to your model. Then change the animtion in the Animator for the default NPC.
Or you can add animations to the Animation Controller. For detailed information go to the file that contains Animation Controller.
Above only works for legacy and generic models. If your model is a humanoid you will have to change the Animation Controller to execute humanoid animations.
The Animation Controller uses CrossFade( ) to play animations which does not work for humaniods. Change the CrossFade( ) to something that can execute humanoid animations.

The NPC component has variables you can alter:
NPC Name
Vision Range
Vision Layers(What layers the npc can see)
Age
Job(Used to choose which interaction to play)
Gender(Used to choose which interaction to play)
Home(Where the NPC will go for the night)
Work(Where the NPC will go for the day)
Current State(Current state of the NPC)
Movement & Running variables
Work Script(Script that executes when the NPC is in the 'work' state)
Conver Choose (How likely the NPC will start a conversation. Per frame) 

To see how to add in new conversations go to NPC dialogues/npc-npc dialogues
