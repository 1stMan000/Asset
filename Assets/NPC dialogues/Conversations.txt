To add in dialogues you must write a txt file in this order.
!Male(Gender of npc)
!Farmer(Job of npc)
Hello(Any sentences you want)
How are you doing?
Bye
!Male(Gender of npc2)
!Farmer(Job of npc2)
Hi
I am fine
Goodbye

Note that you have to put !before the gender and job of the npc

If there are 2 npcs near by the asset will find which conversations it can assign. This conversation will only show up if both npcs are male farmers.
Once the conversation is chosen the npc will speak:
npc: Hello
npc2: Hi
npc: How are you doing?
npc2: I am fine
npc: Bye
npc2: Goodbye

Before you start you need to add a Text Loader script into the scene. The path variable must be the same as the conversation.txt are at.
