Animation Controller calls animations. You can use it by adding ChangeAnimation(\AnimationController.animationName, AnimationLayers.layer, bool block) in other scripts.
You can define a new animation by declaring:
public static readonly string animationName = "actualAnimationNameInsideAnimator"

Layer means which layer will the animation play on. Put two layers named 'LowerBody', 'UpperBody'. To play only the first layer put AnimationLayers.LowerBody
To play the second put AnimationLayers.UpperBody. To play all layers type put AnimationLayers.All

Block means that no other animations can be played while the animation is being played. If the bool is false another animation can be called and overrride the previous animation.
